# Healthcare Templates Assessment

_3 repositories for healthcare practice websites_

---

## Overview

| Repo | Specialty | Status | Verdict |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| psicologia-ia | Psychology | 🟢 Ready | Template complete |
| mikie-fisio | Physiotherapy | 🟡 WIP | Personal project |
| Odontology | Dental | 🟡 Incomplete | Needs work |

---

## The Business Model

**Template products:** Build once, sell many times.

1. Clone template
2. Customize branding/content
3. Deploy for client
4. Charge: $500-2000 setup + $50-200/month

**Target market:** Healthcare practices in Paraguay/LatAm

## psicologia-ia ⭐⭐⭐

**Psychology practice template**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | Python |
| Last push | Feb 2026 |
| Description | "AI-powered tools for psychology practice management" |

### Features (Presumably)

- Session transcription
- AI-assisted analysis
- Business planning tools
- Patient management

### Assessment

- **Most complete** of the three templates
- **Clear target:** Psychologists wanting AI tools
- **Ready for use:** Could deploy for a client now

### Roast

It's a template. Has anyone used it? Is there a live deployment? A template nobody uses is just a demo.

### Verdict

**Keep.** Best candidate for first healthcare template sale. But need to actually sell it.

## mikie-fisio ⭐⭐

**Physiotherapy template**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript |
| Last push | Feb 2026 |
| Contact | Mikie (+595991763400) |

### Assessment

- **Personal project:** Built for/with Mikie
- **Recent activity:** Someone is working on it
- **TypeScript:** Different stack from psicologia-ia (Python)

### Roast

Is this a template or Mikie's actual website? If it's for one person, it's not a template product — it's a freelance project.

### Verdict

**Clarify purpose.** If it's Mikie's site, great — finish it. If it's meant to be a template, generalize it.

---

## Odontology ⭐

**Dental clinic template**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | None detected |
| Last push | Dec 2025 |
| Description | "Multi-clinic resale" |

### Assessment

- **Ambitious:** "Multi-clinic resale" implies B2B
- **Incomplete:** No language detected = minimal code
- **Stale:** 7 weeks since activity

### Roast

"Multi-clinic resale" but there's barely any code. You can't resell what doesn't exist. This is a placeholder, not a product.

### Verdict

**Either build it or archive it.** Half-finished templates have zero value.

---

## The Real Question

**Are you in the healthcare template business or not?**

If YES:
1. Pick ONE template (psicologia-ia)
2. Finish it completely
3. Deploy for ONE paying client
4. Get a testimonial
5. Then build the next one

If NO:
1. Archive all three
2. Focus on Vete
3. Maybe revisit later

**What you're doing now:** Building three incomplete templates with zero clients. That's not a business.

---

## Stack Inconsistency

| Template | Language | Issue |
|----------|----------|-------|
| psicologia-ia | Python | Different from Vete |
| mikie-fisio | TypeScript | Matches Vete |
| Odontology | None | No code |

**Problem:** Different stacks mean different maintenance burden. Standardize on TypeScript (like Vete) for easier maintenance.

---

## Recommendations

### If Pursuing Healthcare Templates

**Phase 1: Validate**
1. Contact 5 psychologists in Paraguay
2. Ask: "Would you pay $1000 for this?"
3. If 2+ say yes, proceed

**Phase 2: First Sale**
1. Deploy psicologia-ia for one paying client
2. Charge $500 setup + $100/month
3. Get testimonial

**Phase 3: Scale**
1. If Phase 2 works, build dental template
2. Use same stack (TypeScript/Next.js)
3. Repeat sales process

### If Not Pursuing

1. Archive all three repos
2. Note: "Healthcare templates - paused, revisit Q3 2026"
3. Focus entirely on Vete

---

## Connection to Vete

Vete is a **veterinary** clinic management system. These are templates for **human** healthcare. There's potential synergy:

**Shared components:**
- Appointment booking
- Patient records
- Billing
- Staff management

**Opportunity:** Extract Vete's core components into a shared healthcare template system.

**Risk:** Scope creep. Focus on Vete first.
