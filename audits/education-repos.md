## courses-website ⭐⭐

**The platform that doesn't have students**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript |
| Last push | Dec 2025 (7 weeks ago) |
| Description | "Summer courses, Certifications, Progress Tracking" |

### The Reality

- Website exists but is it deployed?
- No students enrolled (presumably)
- Features promised: certifications, progress tracking

### Roast

You built a learning management system before having learners. Classic mistake. The website isn't the product — the course content is.

### Verdict

**Pause development.** Focus on Vete revenue. Revisit when you have:
1. Actual course content ready
2. 5+ people who want to pay

---

## Courses-Content ⭐⭐⭐

**The actual content**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | Python |
| Last push | Today |
| Description | "QA automation and AI integration" |

### Assessment

- **Has substance:** Actual course materials
- **Active:** Recent pushes (automated?)
- **Focused:** QA automation is a teachable skill

### Content Likely Includes

- AI prompt engineering
- QA automation techniques
- Practical examples

### Verdict

**Keep.** This is the valuable part. The content, not the platform.

---

## courses-projects-examples ⭐⭐

**Example projects for students**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | Python |
| Last push | Jan 2026 |
| Description | "Two projects with practical examples, using only AI and prompts" |

### Assessment

- Clear purpose: show students what's possible
- Focused: AI + prompts practical examples
- Decent documentation (presumably)

### Verdict

**Keep as reference.** Good supplementary material for Courses-Content.

---

## Summer-courses ⭐

**Summer is over**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Language | Python |
| Last push | Dec 2025 |
| Description | "Summer courses repository" |

### The Problem

It's February. In Paraguay, summer is December-February. This repo is either:
1. For last summer (over)
2. For next summer (too early)

### Roast

Seasonal repo that's out of season. Did the summer courses happen? Where are the students?

### Verdict

**Archive.** Merge any useful content into Courses-Content.

---

## The Education Business Reality

### What You Have
- A website (courses-website)
- Content (Courses-Content)
- Examples (courses-projects-examples)
- Seasonal thing (Summer-courses)

### What You're Missing
- Students
- Payment processing
- Marketing (actual, not 12 dead repos)
- Testimonials

### Honest Assessment

Education is a valid business. But it requires:

1. **Audience first:** Do you have an email list? Social following?
2. **Free content:** Blog posts, YouTube, LinkedIn to attract students
3. **Paid content:** The courses themselves
4. **Proof:** Testimonials, case studies, student outcomes

You have #3 partially. Everything else is missing.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Archive Summer-courses** into Courses-Content
2. **Pause courses-website** development

### If Pursuing Education
1. Pick ONE topic (QA automation? AI prompts?)
2. Create 3 free blog posts/videos
3. Build an email list of 100 interested people
4. THEN revisit the platform

### Consolidation

```
Current:
courses-website/       ← Platform (premature)
Courses-Content/       ← Content (valuable)
courses-projects-examples/  ← Examples (useful)
Summer-courses/        ← Seasonal (dead)

Proposed:
ai-whisperers-courses/
├── content/           ← From Courses-Content
├── examples/          ← From courses-projects-examples
├── archive/           ← From Summer-courses
└── README.md          ← What this is, how to use
```

One repo. Clear purpose. No confusion.
