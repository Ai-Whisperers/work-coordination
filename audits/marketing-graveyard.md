# Marketing Graveyard Analysis 💀

_12 repositories that represent unrealized business ambitions_

---

## The Problem

**12 marketing-related repositories. Zero customers.**

This is classic "playing business" — building infrastructure for customers that don't exist. Every hour spent on marketing automation is an hour not spent on the product.

## The Repos

### 1. ai-whisperers-portfolio-website
- **Last push:** Jan 2026 (6 weeks ago)
- **Language:** TypeScript

- **Last push:** Jan 2026
- **Language:** HTML (docs)

### 5. Company-resarcher
- **Last push:** Dec 2025
- **Language:** HTML
- **Description:** "Lead intelligence gathering tool"

- **Last push:** Nov 2025

### 9. feedbackLens
- **Last push:** Jan 2026

## The Pattern

```
1. "We should do marketing"
2. Build automation tool
3. Never use automation tool
4. Repo goes stale
5. Repeat with different tool
```

**This is procrastination disguised as productivity.**

---

## What To Do

### Archive (Today)
These add zero value:
- Company-resarcher (can't even spell it)
- Comment-Exctractor (same)
- social-media-intelligence-marketing (just docs)
- outreach-automation (3+ months dead)

### Consolidate (This Week)
These are the same product in different repos:
- customer-feedback-app + feedbackLens + feedbackScope-backend = ONE PRODUCT

### Keep (Maybe)
If you actually want to do marketing:
- marketing-strategy (as reference only)
- ai-whisperers-portfolio-website (update with Vete)

### Delete (Be Honest)
- linkedin-content-system (are you using LinkedIn?)
- AI-powered-marketing-campaign-generator (campaigns for what?)

---

## The Hard Truth

**You don't have a marketing problem. You have a product problem.**

Vete is in production but has zero customers. That's not because of missing marketing automation. It's because:

1. No customer validation
2. No sales process
3. No pricing page
4. No onboarding flow

**Fix the product first. Marketing comes after.**

---

## Recommended Focus

Instead of 12 marketing repos:

1. **Vete landing page** with pricing
2. **One case study** (even a beta user)
3. **Email to 10 vets** asking if they'd try it

That's marketing. Everything else is noise.
