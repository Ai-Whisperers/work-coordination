## 🔥 THE ROAST

### The Good
- **Vete** is the real deal — production app, good test coverage, active development
- **work-coordination** is innovative — git-based agent swarm is clever
- **Research repos** have real science — p-adic geometry is legit

### The Bad
- **12 marketing repos** and zero customers — that's called "playing business"
- **LangAi has exposed credentials** — still not fixed after being flagged
- **50% of repos haven't been touched in 2+ months**
- **No consistent standards** — some have CI, most don't

### The Ugly
- **scrapped-comments** — literally a repo for scraped data. Why is this on GitHub?
- **Information-Archive** — an archive of... what? No description
- **Comment-Exctractor** — can't even spell "Extractor"
- **Multiple "template" repos** that were never used as templates

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **🚨 FIX LangAi credentials** — rotate keys NOW
2. **Archive 10+ dead marketing repos** — they're noise
3. **Delete truly empty repos** — geoprot, blueprint-*, etc.

### Short-term (This Week)
4. **Consolidate research repos** — do you need 10?
5. **Add CI to all active repos** — use reusable workflows
6. **Update .github org templates** — PR template, issue templates

### Medium-term (This Month)
7. **Pick 3 products max** — Vete, Courses, one other
8. **Archive everything else** — reduce cognitive load
9. **Document what remains** — READMEs for everything
